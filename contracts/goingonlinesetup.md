# Going Online — Setup & Build Instructions

This document shows step‑by‑step instructions (commands and examples) to build and test the `cardano-escrow` Aiken project locally (offline-friendly) and how to transition to a proper online build when you're ready. Follow only the sections you need.

-- Summary

- Local-first (offline) workflow: use local `lib/` shims or vendored packages and keep `dependencies` commented out in `aiken.toml` while learning and iterating.
- Online workflow: pin and restore dependencies in `aiken.toml` and let Aiken fetch packages from GitHub.

This file has been removed as part of repository cleanup.
If you need the going-online instructions later, see `docs/SETUP.md` or recreate this file.

- Windows PowerShell (you are using PowerShell v5.1) — run commands in the project root `C:\messi\blockPay\contracts`.
